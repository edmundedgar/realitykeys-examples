# This script allows two parties who don't trust each other to create a contract conditional on the outcome of a Reality Key.
# The actual Reality Keys are fetched automatically using the Reality Keys API, so the users only need to supply their own keys.
# It requires pybitcointools. It has been tested on version 1.1.15.
# Pybitcointools is maintained here
# Use the stable branch - master may not work.
# https://github.com/edmundedgar/pybitcointools
# You can also get this library via Pip:
# pip install pybitcointools==1.1.15
 

# Steps:
 
# Alice: Creates keys and sends the public key to Bob.   
#    ./realitykeysdemo.py makekeys
#    Get the public key and send it to Bob.
#    Temporarily fund her own address with her stake using any bitcoin client. 
#    (This step makes things simpler here, although there are ways to avoid this step.)

# Bob: Creates keys and sends the pubkey to Alice. 
#    ./realitykeysdemo.py makekeys
#    Get the public key and send it to Alice.
#    Temporarily fund his own address with his stake.

# Alice and Bob: Register a Reality Key, and get the ID <reality_key_id> from the URL.
# NB If using ECC voodoo with the --ecc-voodoo option, they should make sure the Reality Keys were newly created and didn't exist before they exchanged keys.

# If Bob or Alice disappears before completing the transaction, the other person can get the money back from the temporary address with:
#    ./realitykeysdemo.py pay <address> -a <amount> -f [<fee>]"

# Alice: 
#    Creates a P2SH address spendable by a combination of ( her key + rk-yes ) or ( his key + rk-no ).
#    Then creates a transaction spending the contents of both her and Bob's temporary address to the P2SH address, signed with her private key.
#    ./realitykeysdemo.py setup <reality_key_id> <yes_winner_public_key> <yes_stake_amount> <no_winner_public_key> <no_stake_amount>" 
#    (This outputs a serialized, partially-signed transaction which she then sends to Bob who will complete and broadcast it.)

# Bob: Recreates Alice's transaction to make sure he gets the same thing, then signs it with his private key and broadcasts it.
#    ./realitykeysdemo.py setup <reality_key_id> <yes_winner_public_key> <yes_stake_amount> <no_winner_public_key> <no_stake_amount> <transaction_only_half_signed>" 

# ...Wait until the result is issued...

# Alice or Bob (whoever wins):
#    ./realitykeysdemo.py claim <reality_key_id> <yes_winner_public_key> <no_winner_public_key> -f [<fee>] -d [<destination_address>]
